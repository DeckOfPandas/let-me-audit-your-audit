Junior doctors are not a small group of young trainees. They make up almost half of all doctors in hospitals in England. As of June 2017, of the 106,000 doctors in NHS hospitals and community health services in England, 50,000 were junior doctors. 

All of them are qualified to practice medicine, and some have ten years of practical experience on top of this. So the title “junior doctor” often does not reflect their level of responsibility.

As part of their postgraduate training requirements, junior doctors have to carry out audits and quality improvement projects. These audits usually involve measuring something, then comparing that to something else; for example guidelines, local epidemiological data, or another ward in the same hospital. Ideally some intervention would be proposed in order to bring the measured aspect in line with other similar data. The ideal audit would "close the loop", meaning that the same measurement is made again following the implementation of the intervention in order to assesss its impact.

Given that all this work is being done.....where is it? Are we at the point of being able to combine data across wards, hospitals or even CCGs, to get a direct grass-roots measure of how care is being delivered? Why on earth not!?

It would be fair to say that most doctors don't say things like, "Oh I'm so glad to have the chance to do this audit". It's true that most audits are never heard of again, so work may be repeated with opportunities for closing the loop missed or mismanaged. What a colossal waste of time. But most people don't actively enjoy spending their time doing something pointless. Can we allow doctors the ability to conduct interesting audits if they want, and to feel like they are part of an evidence base that -- taken together -- might really /matter/...?

And being brutal, at the end of the day many might want to "Just get it done", and...you know what? fair enough. Those doctors might appreciate being able to find out where the low-hanging fruit is.

tl;dr: 
* Tell me how to pick an audit topic that isn't a waste of time 
* Catch and integrate trainees' output so even potentially useful audits don't turn out to be a waste of time
* Or at least tell me how to waste /less/ of my time
